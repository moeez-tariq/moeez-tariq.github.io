  'In addition to their vitamin and mineral content, dates are fruits that are rich in health-protective antioxidants. One 2019 study found that dates are a good source of natural antioxidants, which can be used to manage oxidative stress-related illnesses.',
  'Many people think of dates as dried fruitâ€”but they are actually fresh fruit since no water is removed. And because dates are whole, unprocessed fruit, their sugar content is naturally occurring. In other words, if an energy bar is sweetened only with dates, the label can list zero grams of added sugar.',
  'Three dates provide about 18% of the daily goal for fiber, which supports good digestive function. Dates can improve bowel movement frequency and reduce level of stool chemicals known to damage cells and trigger mutations that may lead to cancer',
  'Dates could potentially have a beneficial effect on lipid profile, especially in reducing total cholesterol and elevating HDL, because of the high polyphenolic content of dates (polyphenols are micronutrients that naturally occur in plants) ensuring better cardiovascular health.',
  'Protective compounds in dates are also thought to help guard the brain. According to a paper published in 2016, dates have promising therapeutic potential against Alzheimers disease due to their ability to combat inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain.','Three dates provide about 200 calories, 54 grams of carbohydrates with about five grams of fiber, a gram of protein, and no fat. This portion also supplies smaller amounts of a wide range of nutrients, including B vitamins, vitamin K, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, and manganese.'
