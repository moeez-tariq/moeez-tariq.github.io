# Project Name: 30MFF Website (Snack Kitchen)

### Project Description:

Our video demonstrated how to make a quick snack using ingredients that could be easily found at the convenience store on campus.  The website is for all those people who find it difficult to eat between classes because of hectic schedules or who think they can't cook. This website is also for those who don't want to snack on unhealthy items anymore. The aim is to provide access to easy-to-make quick snacks that are healthy and  can be made in the comfort of one's own dorm room. We want to encourage students to take control of their diets and make healthier choices, even when they are busy with classes and extracurricular activities. The main star snack on the website is the date snack,  which is not only healthy but also a part of the local culture. However, we also have other snack recipes available for students to try. The website also provides information on the benefits of dates to encourage students to choose this snack as a healthy option. Through this website,  we hope to create a community of healthy snackers who can share their own recipes and tips for making quick and healthy snacks. To get started, I brainstormed some ideas for the website and eventually settled on a minimalistic and symmetric design with a brown theme to match the color of the ingredients (chocolate, date, and peanut butter) in the snack. I wanted the site to be easy to navigate, with all of the necessary information easily accessible on the main page. After sketching out a Y-frame for the website and presenting it to my classmates, I got the green light to proceed with the project.

### Process:

Initially, I found the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript aspects of website creation to be quite challenging. While I did have some prior experience with coding, I knew that I needed to polish my skills to create a website that looked professional and was easy to navigate. I spent a lot of time watching YouTube tutorials to learn more about HTML and CSS, following them to add tags for images and videos. Once I felt comfortable with these aspects, I started working on the HTML page itself. I made sure to add IDs and classes to almost all of the elements on the page to make it easier to style with CSS. The CSS aspect of the project proved to be the most challenging for me. I found that even minor changes in one element could throw off the entire layout and misalign everything. After a lot of trial and error, I finally got the result I was satisfied with. I also discovered that it was better to upload the video on YouTube and then embed it on the website to avoid size restrictions. I created a YouTube channel, uploaded the video, and embedded it on the webpage, which worked perfectly. Adding the JavaScript element was much easier for me since I had prior experience with coding and understood the basics of arrays and counters. I quickly set up the JavaScript element and made sure that it worked seamlessly with the rest of the website. Finally, I realized that I had forgotten to add a logo to the website. A friend of mine provided me with a template to create the logo, but adding it to the page displaced all of the elements. It took me about 30 minutes to realign everything so that the logo fit seamlessly with the rest of the page. But eventually
the website was completed.

### Reflection:

When I reflect on the 30MFF Website (Snack Kitchen) project, I'm extremely satisfied with the outcome. As someone who had never made a website before, I completed 98% of the things I originally intended to do, and I feel like the website is able to showcase my goal of encouraging students at NYUAD to beat hunger between classes by making their own snacks, in their own dorms, using the ingredients found at the convenience store. Our main snack is the date snack, and there are other snack recipes available on the website as well. In addition, the website provides information on the benefits of dates to encourage students to choose this snack. The website also includes a feedback form to get the feedback of students on these recipes and a "submit your own recipe" form that allows students to share their versions of different snacks influenced by culture and creativity. The one aspect of the project that I particularly enjoyed was the ability to combine my interests in food and design. I loved the idea of creating a website that not only shared recipes, but also encouraged students to experiment and share their own. The feedback form and the recipe submission form were an important part of this idea. I believe that this creates a sense of community and encourages students 
to share their experiences, cultures, and creativity with one another. Despite my satisfaction with the final product, I can still think of a few things that could have been improved. For example, the search bar could have worked better, and the submit feedback or recipe buttons could have functioned properly. Moreover, I could have added more information on separate pages about our team and written an anecdote about how I used to starve before discovering the date snack. The feedback form and recipe submissions could have been shown in a separate tab, and I could have implemented a 5-star rating system as well. Out of all of these, the 5-star rating system was the only thing I planned on doing but was not able to do. Others, I already knew I would have to polish my skills further to achieve those improvements.
Despite these potential improvements, I believe my website tells the "story" that I wanted to tell, and I'm proud of the final product. This project taught me a lot, and despite the frustration of misaligned divs, I feel a sense of accomplishment when I look at the end product. I plan to continue working on the website to improve upon it and fix any issues that I identify. I am proud of what I was able to accomplish, especially as someone who had never created a website before. I found the experience to be challenging, yet rewarding. Throughout the process, I was constantly learning new skills and facing new challenges that forced me to think critically and creatively.
